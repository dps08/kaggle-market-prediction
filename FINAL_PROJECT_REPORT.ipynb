    "## 2. Data Pre-processing\n",
    "\n### 2.1 What pre-processing techniques did you apply?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Value Imputation:** Forward-fill then median imputation\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling:** RobustScaler (median and IQR-based)\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering:** Lagged features, rolling statistics, interactions\n",
    "4. **Time-based Splitting:** Chronological train/validation/test split (70/15/15)\n",
    "5. **Outlier Handling:** RobustScaler handles outliers better than StandardScaler\n",
    "\n### 2.2 How did you handle missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "1. **Forward Fill:** For time-series continuity (carries last known value forward)\n",
    "2. **Median Imputation:** For remaining missing values after forward fill\n",
    "3. **Rationale:** Median is robust to outliers, forward fill preserves temporal patterns\n",
    "\n**Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Forward fill for time series\n",
    "df = df.fillna(method='ffill')\n",
    "# Median imputation for remaining\n",
    "df = df.fillna(df.median())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n### 2.3 Handling categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "- D1-D9 are already binary encoded (0/1)\n",
    "- No additional encoding needed\n",
    "- These features were kept as-is in the model\n",
    "\n### 2.4 Normalization/Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** RobustScaler\n",
    "\n**Why RobustScaler:**\n",
    "- Uses median and IQR instead of mean and standard deviation\n",
    "- Robust to outliers (financial data has extreme events like crashes)\n",
    "- Better for financial time series with fat tails\n",
    "\n**Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "X_scaled = (X - median(X)) / IQR(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n### 2.5 Handling outliers and skewed distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outlier Strategy:**\n",
    "1. **RobustScaler:** Automatically handles outliers in scaling\n",
    "2. **No Removal:** Outliers represent real market events (crashes, rallies)\n",
    "3. **Winsorization:** Applied to target variable using MAD criterion\n",
    "\n**Skewness Handling:**\n",
    "- Financial returns are naturally skewed\n",
    "- RobustScaler handles skewness better than StandardScaler\n",
    "- No log transformation applied (returns can be negative)\n",
    "\n### 2.6 Handling imbalanced dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Balance:**\n",
    "- Positive days: 51.68%\n",
    "- Negative days: 48.32%\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** Dataset is balanced, no resampling needed\n",
    "\n**Note:** This is regression, not classification, so SMOTE not applicable\n",
    "\n### 2.7 Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques Used:**\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection:** LightGBM feature importance\n",
    "2. **No PCA:** Wanted interpretable features for financial domain\n",
    "3. **Correlation-based removal:** Removed features with >0.95 correlation\n",
